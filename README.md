# Ultraviolet-Actions

This repo will help you get Ultraviolet running under GitHub Actions, with the power of localtunnel.me and Node.js

# Setup

To get this running, you will first need to fork my repository.

All you need to do is hit the Fork button to begin the fork process.

![forkbutton](https://github.com/kingofnetflix/ultraviolet-actions/blob/main/images/forkbutton.png?raw=true)

After that, to process the fork, hit the Create Fork button at the bottom (if not scrolled down)

![forkprocess](https://github.com/kingofnetflix/ultraviolet-actions/blob/main/images/fork.png?raw=true)

Now, you can go to Actions by pressing the Actions button.

It will warn you that you should not run workflows on a forked repository, but in this case I have set everything up for you, so you can just go ahead and enable them.

Now, go to the Ultraviolet-Node section, click on Run Workflow, and run it, run it, run it!

You might need to refresh the page to see the Ultraviolet-Node workflow, but once you see it, make sure to click it.

Now that your in the workflow output, just wait a bit and you should see the link under the step ```tunnel and expose to web```. It should look something like this.
