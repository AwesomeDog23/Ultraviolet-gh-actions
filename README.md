# Setup

To get this running, you will first need to fork my repository.

All you need to do is hit the Fork button to begin the fork process.

Now, you can go to Actions by pressing the Actions button.

It will warn you that you should not run workflows on a forked repository, but in this case I have set everything up for you, so you can just go ahead and enable them.

Now, go to the Ultraviolet-Node section, click on Run Workflow, and run it, run it, run it!

You might need to refresh the page to see the Ultraviolet-Node workflow, but once you see it, make sure to click it.
